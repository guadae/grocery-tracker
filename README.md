GROCERY TRACKER (in progress) 

This application is meant to simplify creating grocery lists and keep track of what is being sent. I used HTML, CSS3, CSS Grid, SASS, and vanilla JS to create this. 

The reason why is because I wanted to learn and experiment more with manual responsiveness to become more familiar with CSS--- more specifically SASS. Using SASS has allowed me to take advantage of its functionalities to nest styles and create easier to read responsiveness. I also wanted to attain more javascript skills to better understand how to manipulate the DOM. 

Challenges I have faced while creating this application included figuring out how to create popup modals, learning how to understand javascript and apply it, and how to position the boxes as close to the design I had as much as possible using CSS grid. I hope to implement multiple things: (1) fetching an API that changes every 24 hours that include positive quotes that one can see when they open the dashboard, (2) when a list has been created and a user exits out of the popup modal-- it will be saved into the "lists" section of the application automatically (and more specifically I would like to give the users the ability to create, update, and delete entries), and (3) modulize the code so that it can be far cleaner than what it is now.

Currently I am working with another individual on this project, but so far all the code that is seen so far has been mine.
